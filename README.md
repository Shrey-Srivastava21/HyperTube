# Hypertube

You may see the live demo here: https://hypertube-scao.herokuapp.com/

This **MERN application (MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, ReactJS)** was made as part of 42's School web branch. 

This app contains several features:
- Login & Sign Up forms
- Fetching datas from The Movie Database website
- Searching and filtering any film by year or genre
- Trailer videos embedded
- Liking, commenting and selecting favorite films options for registered users only
- English and French translations available
- Mobile-friendly

The subject initially asked for a "Netflix-clone" by streaming movies via torrenting - however for legal reasons I removed this part in the deployed demo and embedded YouTube videos instead.
